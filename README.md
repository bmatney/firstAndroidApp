# firstAndroidApp

Today I built my first android app. It could not be much more basic, but it compiles with no errors and installed on my phone, so I am happy with that for now.

It was built following a tutorial found on: https://guides.codepath.com/android/Basic-Todo-App-Tutorial

If you want to just have the install file(apk) it can be found at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4a5RD6T9bs7X2pJVklSNHZTd3M/view?usp=sharing

Yeah, that's about it.
